                This is a prototype for a small game in JavaScript written for the lecture
                "Mobile Computing & Internet of Things" at the Karlsruhe Institute for Technology
                in winter 2019/20.

                    <button class="btn" id="playgame">
                        <a href="game.html" id="gamelink">Play Game</a>

                <h2>
                    Rules
                </h2>
                The goal is to catch as many falling <font color="ffcc66">coins</font> as you can and to avoid the 
                <font color="ff4d4d">bombs</font>.
                You start off with 3 lives; each time the <font color="80dfff">basket</font> touches a bomb, you lose a life.
                There is no time limit. It's game over when you have no more lives left.
            </p>
            <p>
                <h2>
                    Controls
                </h2>
                You can control the basket...
                <ul>
                    <li>using the left/right arrow keys.</li>
                    <li>by moving the mouse.</li>
                    <li>using the gyroscope and tilting your device.</li>
                </ul>
                Not every device has a gyroscope and not every browser supports it.
                For example, this game is playable using the gyroscope in Chrome for iOS devices, but not
                in Safari.
                <br/>
                To test whether the gyroscope is available on the browser and device you are currently
                using, tilt your device to see if the script recognises the device orientation.

                <div id="gyrotest">
                    <center>
                        <div id="alpha">No gyroscope was detected.</div>
                        <div id="beta"></div>
                        <div id="gamma"></div>
                    </center>
