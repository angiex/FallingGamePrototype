            This is a prototype for a small game in JavaScript written for the lecture
            "Mobile Computing & Internet of Things" at the Karlsruhe Institute for Technology
            in winter 2019/20.

            <h2>
                Rules
            </h2>
            The goal is to catch as many falling coins as you can and to avoid the bombs.
            You start off with 3 lives; each time the basket touches a bomb, you lose a life.
            There is no time limit. It's game over when you have no more lives left.
            <!-- Draw coin, bomb, basket and explain -->
        </p>
        <p>
            <h2>
                Controls
            </h2>
            You can control the basket...
            <ul>
                <li>using the left/right arrow keys.</li>
                <li>by moving the mouse.</li>
                <li>using the gyroscope and tilting your device.</li>
            </ul>
            Not every device has a gyroscope and not every browser supports it.
            For example, this game is playable using the gyroscope in Chrome for iOS devices, but not
            in Safari.
            <br/>
            To test whether the gyroscope is available on the browser and device you are currently
            using, tilt your device to see if the script recognises the device orientation.
